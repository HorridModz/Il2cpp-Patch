# WIP, DON'T TRY TO USE

# About
This is a tool I made for a friend. It's a python script to automatically generate gameguardian scripts for il2cpp games. It allows you to patch specific methods or fields, or an entire class. You can specify conditions such as name and data type, to determine what to patch.

# Features
- Patch fields
- Patch methods
- Patch by name
- Patch all fields and / or methods in an **entire class**, filtering by name, data type, and more
- Many types of patches, including ints, strings, bools, arm instructions, nop, and more
- Automatic conversion of patch types - eg: int to float
- Script customization
- Automatic script obfuscation
- Script password generation
- All-update script generation
- Helpful error messages and detailed, configurable logging
